There are two python scripts in the above repository.

The "sample script" .py file includes an algorithm that solves the shortest route problem where a support ship's route between deployed ships need. An excel file is provided with sample data for moving ships. This file is needed to run the code which will output "solutions" and "KPI" excel files. 

The "sum of digits" .py file consists of the code and the .exe is the standalone executable file. It is a simple script that returns the sum of the digits of the number entered by the user.
